# boneyard
Kick through this scrap-heap: maybe you'll find something worth your while?

## Index
How am i gonna do this? Basically, i want to be able to let people facet this on 'logical' group, eg: *libsodium* or *messaging*, and also by implementation detail, eg: *javascript* or *python*. take 1:

## Why no licence?
Often-times, the code here is shamelessly pilfered from someone else, so really, if you use anything here you would be exercising any sort of right under *their* licence (not *mine*). In the rare cases where this work is novel, I'd be happy enough if you attributed my effort in a manner similar to the way i attribute those efforts from which i benefit, with a simple link at a relevant point in the source code.

## What is a boneyard
Those in any sort of fabrication or manufacturing would probably be familiar with the concept, but for mere mortals, it's where good stuff goes to die when the owners have decided that it's 'still good'... but not *good enough*.

So what is 'good stuff'? Well, some of it is 'good', and a lot of it is now, for better or worse, 'crap' - [Marla Singer sums it up beautifully](http://fightclub.wikia.com/wiki/Marla_Singer), albeit in a slightly different context:
> *"I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar. It's a bridesmaid's dress. Someone loved it intensely for one day, and then tossed it. Like a Christmas tree. So special. Then, bam, it's on the side of the road. Tinsel still clinging to it. Like a sex crime victim. Underwear inside out. Bound with electrical tape."*
